ASF2MC8 Branch Displacement
---------------------------

asf2mc8 disassembles branches incorrectly:

.org e000
    bne 0xdffe       ;uses low byte (0xfe) for displacement instead of
                     ;  calculating displacement from PC to 0xdfee

For branch displacement to be calculated, the target has to be an actual
label.  An absolute value or an equate won't work.

Address Marking
---------------

An address might the target of both a JMP and a CALL.  If it is, it should
be marked as a subroutine ("sub_*") not label ("lab_*").
